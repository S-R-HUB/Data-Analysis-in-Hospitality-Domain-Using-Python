## Project Structure
- `/data`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `/output`: Plots and summary tables

## Analysis Steps
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualization
4. Insights & Conclusions

## Key Insights
- 30% of bookings are canceled during peak season.
- Families prefer suite rooms, especially in summer months.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
